       <p>Hello, and welcome to the page all about me! My name is Matt and I am a front-end web developer at your service! A lot of people ask me: "Matt, what motivates you to get up in the morning and learn all these new technologies to write complicated code?" And the short answer I usually say is "Coffee!!" But seriously I do this because in reality I love to solve problems, since I was a kid you could catch me with my face in some type of book trying to absorb ideas and knowledge like that was the meaning of life. In the links above which I encourage you to scroll through; you will find my projects and who knows you may even want to contact me! So again thank you for visiting my site which is still in its infancy at the moment but I constantly keep it updated with whatever it is I am working on. Cheers!  </p>
